## AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools to accelerate design and implementation:

- **Website Creation**: AI generated the responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript website scaffold, including the navigation structure, card-based layout, and theme toggle functionality.
- **Interactive Features**: AI implemented the mouse-follow parallax background, 3D card tilt effects, and smooth scrolling interactions.
- **Decorative SVG Monitor**: AI designed and created the detailed, animated computer monitor graphic that serves as a decorative background element with subtle mouse-tracking parallax.
- **Modal Implementation**: AI built the accessible README modal with open/close controls, keyboard navigation, and overlay functionality.
- **Theme System**: AI developed the light/dark theme toggle with localStorage persistence and CSS variable-based styling.
- **Responsive Design**: AI ensured the website is fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.

The AI assistance streamlined the development process while maintaining code quality, accessibility, and professional design standards. This demonstrates efficient use of AI tools for rapid prototyping and full-stack web development.
